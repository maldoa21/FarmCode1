This module defines system-wide configuration constants including
GPIO pin mappings, communication settings, database paths, and
shared resources like the global stop event for graceful shutdown.

RS485 UART transmit: GPIO 14 (TXD) - Pin 8
RS485 UART receive: GPIO 15 (RXD) - Pin 10
Uses 3.3V logic level
Turn on UART on Raspberry Pi using `sudo raspi-config` and enable the serial interface.
RSE (TX/RX control) is auto by default but high for TX and low for RX.
